# Political Communication surrounding COVID-19

In the United States, President Trump has largely delegated management of the COVID-19 pandemic to individual states. Different State Governors have had widely varying responses to outbreaks of COVID-19 in their own states. Issues like mask wearing, economic shutdowns, etc. have become highly charged and controversial issues, and often political party affiliation is associated with one's beliefs about these issues.

This project in collaboration [Dr. Tom Oliver](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/oliver-thomas/) and [Dr. Ajay Sethi](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/sethi-ajay/) is to look into the possibility of whether tweets from state governors show as much variation by party line as we have seen in other media.
